# TeamNest: Football Management & Analytics Project

A full-stack Java-based application to manage football team personnel, integrate external league data, and deploy in containerized environments. This project demonstrates backend development, frontend design, security, testing, API integration, and deployment skills.

---

## **Project Objectives**

- Build a full-stack application using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **React**.
- Implement **role-based access control** (admin vs user).
- Create a **robust database schema** in MySQL.
- Apply **unit and functional testing** (JUnit, Selenium, Cucumber).
- Integrate external **football APIs** for league and team data.
- Deploy using **Docker** and explore **Kubernetes** for orchestration.
- Provide a scalable and maintainable architecture suitable for production.

---

## **Phase 1: CRUD & Role-Based Management** -> HERE RIGHT NOW

**Goals:**

- Develop backend API in **Java (Spring Boot)** for football team personnel:
  - Employees, coaches, staff members.
  - Standard **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- Implement **MySQL database** with proper relationships and constraints.
- Introduce **role-based access**:
  - **Admin**: Full CRUD operations.
  - **User**: Read-only access.
- Apply **unit testing** for backend logic using **JUnit**.
- Build **React frontend**:
  - Dynamic forms for CRUD.
  - Role-based UI rendering.
  - Responsive tables and views.
- **Functional testing** of frontend using **Selenium + Cucumber**.
- Optional: Basic authentication (JWT) for role enforcement.

**Deliverables:**

- Fully functional backend REST API.
- Interactive React frontend.
- Unit and functional test coverage reports.
- Documentation of endpoints and roles.

## **Phase 2: External Football API Integration & Analytics**

**Goals:**

- Integrate with public football APIs (e.g., Football-data.org, API-Football):
  - Fetch data for leagues, teams, players, fixtures, and results.
- Design **database schema** for storing external API data:
  - Historical results, team stats, player performance.
- Implement backend services for **data ingestion and storage**.
- Extend frontend to visualize:
  - League tables and standings.
  - Match schedules and results.
  - Player and team statistics dashboards.
- Reuse **role-based access**:
  - Admin: manage internal records.
  - User: view analytics and league data (read-only).

**Deliverables:**

- Backend services consuming and storing API data.
- Extended React frontend with analytics dashboards.
- API documentation for internal and external data endpoints.
- Demonstration of data synchronization and integration.

---

## **Phase 3: Containerization & Deployment**

**Goals:**

- Containerize backend and frontend using **Docker**:
  - Separate images for Spring Boot API, React frontend, and MySQL database.
  - Compose using **Docker Compose** for local orchestration.
- Explore **Kubernetes deployment** (optional advanced phase):
  - Define deployment manifests and services.
  - Demonstrate scalability and self-healing.
- Ensure **environment consistency** for development, testing, and production.

**Deliverables:**

- Docker images and Compose setup for full-stack environment.
- Kubernetes manifests for backend, frontend, and database.
- Documentation for local and cluster deployment.
- Portfolio-ready showcase demonstrating DevOps awareness.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), JPA/Hibernate, RESTful APIs.
- **Frontend:** React, Axios, Material-UI (or preferred component library).
- **Database:** MySQL, relational modeling.
- **Testing:** JUnit, Selenium, Cucumber.
- **Security:** JWT or Spring Security for role-based access.
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (optional).

---

## **Future Improvements**

- Advanced filtering and search functionality in frontend.
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
- Advanced analytics (e.g., player performance trends, league predictions).
- Full production-ready deployment with monitoring and logging.
